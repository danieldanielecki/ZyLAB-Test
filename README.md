# ZyLAB test

This project is a test for ZyLAB front end case with description in a file [https://gitlab.com/danieldanielecki/zylab-test/blob/master/DESCRIPTION.md](DESCRIPTION.md).

## Missing

The following elements are missing or partially working:

- "For each author you should provide a list his books as Read-Only info." Reason: lack of skills/maybe architecture too.
- "When you remove author - all his books should be removed as well in cascade manner." Reason: architecture without allowance to include Book item in Auhor.
- "E2E/Unit tests". Reason: time.

## Extras

Some things has been delivered as extra fetures, these are:

- "**OPTIONAL** User should be able to create a new Book.".
- Sorting/pagination of results.
- Save/Fetch results to Firebase database.
- State management.
- Monorepository.
- Pipelines.
- Small showcase how to deal with secrets, taking an example of API keys and obviously Firebase access token to the server.

## Deployment

Production environment [https://zylab-prod.web.app/](https://zylab-dev.web.app/), as well as development [https://zylab-dev.web.app/](https://zylab-dev.web.app/). Currently they are the same.

## Feedback (a bit questioned...)

1. Code is not structured properly
2. A lot of bugs
3. Application is breaking
4. Disregarded instructions of assignment
